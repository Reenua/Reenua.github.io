<h1>Elevator speech</h1>
<p>
Hello, my name is Reenua Jones, and in case you were wondering it’s pronounced as Ree-na. My mom put the U in there to give me a hard time for all of my life. Before we start on this beautifully written bio about me id just like thank just in case I forget later. First the lightning round, im 20 years old(will be 21 in March 2020), im African American, I'm female, my favorite color is red, and I LOVE Disney, it may border a bit of an obsession. I'd like to believe that i'm very open to all things in the world, whether it be social, political, orbital, anything. I am  a Junior at Colorado State University-Pueblo majoring in Mass Communications with an emphasis in Integrated Communications . My goal and dream job, is to be an executive creative director for Walt Disney Studios.

<h2>TANGENT TIME!!!</h2>
<p>
It all started on a warm spring day in March, on the 25th to be exact. God decided to make me and Aries, he may regret that later. I was born, and life has never been the same. As a baby I was loud, rambunctious and had a mind of my own...nothing’s really changed since then. But I  started to find out more about myself in middle and highschool. Id say my journey is like spring or more specifically a flower. I was open and bright when I was young, then puberty hit and I lost a bit about myself, but I gained a better understanding of people.

So we all have had that group of friends, where you guys would do everything together and you just knew you guys would be friends for life… yeah its ok, I was blind too.In middle school we were thick as thieves then in highschool I either was oblivious, we grew a part or all of the above. When I think back on it, its funny because the sign that I knew we weren't friends anymore was the Disney phenomena Frozen. I have loved Disney ever since I was a baby and everyone in my life is well aware of that fact. Tell me why out of our little group of 8 did the 7 of them go and not invite me? You can tell that I was really hurt by that, considering now im 20 and Frozen came out in the 2013-2014 school year. Long story short I stopped being friends with them. I can say I learned a pretty important lesson though. No matter how long you can know someone, they can change in an instant. Also if something truly isn't benefiting you, just leave
