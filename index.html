     I'd like to believe that I'm very open to all things in the world, whether it be social, political, orbital, anything. 
     I am  a Junior at Colorado State University-Pueblo majoring in Mass Communications with an emphasis in Integrated Communications.

    <h3>TANGENT TIME!!!</h3>
</body>

<body>
    <p>It all started on a warm spring day in March, on the 25th to be exact. 
     God decided to make me and Aries, he may regret that later. I was born, and life has never been the same. 
     As a baby I was loud, rambunctious and had a mind of my own...nothing’s really changed since then.
      But I  started to find out more about myself in middle and highschool. 
     I'd say my journey is like spring or more specifically a flower. I was open and bright when I was young, 
     then puberty hit and I lost a bit about myself, but I gained a better understanding of people.
