     My mom put the U in there to give me a hard time for all of my life. Before we start on this beautifully written bio about me id just like thank just in case I forget later. 
     First the lightning round, im 20 years old(will be 21 in March 2020), im African American, I'm female, my favorite color is red, and I LOVE Disney, it may border a bit of an obsession. 
     I'd like to believe that I'm very open to all things in the world, whether it be social, political, orbital, anything. 
     I am  a Junior at Colorado State University-Pueblo majoring in Mass Communications with an emphasis in Integrated Communications. 
     My goal and dream job is to be an executive creative director for Walt Disney Studios.
