<h2> Communication is key </h2> 

<body>
    
<p>I have great communication skills and am very personable. 
I am very dependable and persistent when it comes to many tasks. 
I am also good at prioritizing what is most  important in getting a job done. 
I love to stay happy and optimistic in any situation. I am adaptable in many environments. 
I also am a slight perfectionist, so any task or situation, I will complete with the utmost professionalism and style. 
Lastly as generation z, I am far mor advanced than any millinieal. I'd like to think I'm pretty cool.

<h2>BACK TO YOU REGULARLY SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING!
</h2>

<p>That moment taught me how to be independent and honestly it defined my highschool experience. I was your average student who didn't really apply myself and was honestly done with the “forced” education system. 
    I graduated with a 2.8, but hey I at least graduated and I went to college. I had a few options, but at the end of the day, I went to Colorado State University Pueblo.
    I did everything you average college student would do, but my biggest achievement was making the dean's list every semester since I have been there. 
    I've figured out that I have a gift for writing and understanding people which has led me to a flourishing mass communication degree.
